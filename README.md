## Introduction

AskChain aims to simplify the often complex and intimidating world of Web3 by providing a platform where users can ask any question, no matter how "stupid" it may seem, and get rewarded for sharing their knowledge. With zk-KYC mechanisms for security, AI-powered assistance for instant answers, and account abstraction to ensure a Web2-like onboarding experience, AskChain sets a new standard for user-friendly decentralized platforms.

## Features

- **Token-Based Incentives**: Users earn tokens for providing helpful answers, fostering an active and engaged community.
- **Web2-Like Onboarding**: Leveraging account abstraction, AskChain offers a seamless onboarding experience that feels just like using a Web2 platform.
- **Anonymous Questioning**: Users can ask questions anonymously, with their identity protected by zk-KYC.
- **AI-Powered Assistance**: An AI model trained on user-submitted data provides instant answers to common questions.
- **Project Integration**: Web3 projects can register on AskChain, offering dedicated sections for user interaction and uploading documentation.
- **DAO Governance**: The platform's future is governed by a DAO, allowing the community to propose and vote on changes.

## Architecture

AskChain is built on a decentralized architecture, leveraging smart contracts for token distribution and governance, zk-KYC for identity verification, and AI models for automated responses. The platform is designed to be modular, allowing for the integration of additional features like the AI plugin for project websites.
